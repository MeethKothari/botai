I have created 4 components 
=> SideBar, CurrentConversation, ShowPastConversation, FeedbackModal

# The sidebar consists of the newchat column and past conversation section,
# The CurrentConversation consists of chat section
#  The ShowPastConversation is a conditional component created-> whenever the past conversation button is clicked from the sidebar it will render the conversation that were saved by the user 
# The FeedBackModal is also a conditional component which will be rendered only in the case when user clicks on feedback button for their suggestions.

In most of the cases i have passed props for rendering process
